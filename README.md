## Coding To Complete The Blockchain

Deep Dive Codeathon 2019 will be Friday October 4th through Sunday October 6th at [Free Range](https://freerangespaces.com/)!

The 2019 Deep Dive Code-A-Thon is a Blockchain inspired event for developers to collaborate with other computer programmers and mentors to develop their ideas. It is a weekend hackathon where coders will come together, form teams, and build cool DApps (Decentralized Applications) or software applications. The opening night will coincide with the conclusion of the [BlockFiesta conference](https://www.blockfiesta.org/), a day-long conference focused on the uses of Blockchain technology.
